Backups in S3 and Glacier

# Three ways to store files in Amazon

Standard storage, Infrequent Access Storage and Glacier.
Differ on availability, durability, price for storage and price for retrieval

FIXME a table
  * Standard
    * Availability SLA: 99%
        Durability: 11 9s

    Standard - IA
    Glacier

| Method  | Availability SLA | Durability 9s | Storage price | Retrieval price |
|---------|------------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| S3      | 99%              | 11            |               |                 |
| S3-IA   |   |   |   |   |
| Glacier |   |   |   |   |
    
Encrypted buckets FIXME Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Encryption Keys (SSE-C) where they claim not to store the key, and to use some HMAC salted version of the key
FIXME EBS volumes
FIXME Reduced Redundancy Storage

# Lifecycle policies
Some policies can be defined for S3 buckets, like to *promote* a file to Glacier or to S3-IA after 10 or 30 days. Or just to remove it. See [2].

# Conclussions
costs? FIXME glacier is like 4 times lower than s3.
